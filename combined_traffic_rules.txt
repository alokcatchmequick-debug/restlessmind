borne by the consignor and the common carrier shall not be liable for any loss, damage or deterioration

5. Extension of prescribed period in certain cases.—Any appeal or any application, other than an

execution of a decree is, at the time from which the prescribed period is to be reckoned, a minor or insane,

would otherwise have been allowed from the time so specified.

the suit or make the application within the same period after the death, as would otherwise have been 
allowed from the time so specified.

him under this section, his legal representative may institute the suit or make the application within the 
same period after the death, as would otherwise have been available to that person had he not died. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, ‘minor’ includes a child in the womb. 
 7. Disability of one of several persons.—Where one of several persons jointly entitled to institute a 
suit or make an application for the execution of a decree is under any such disability, and a discharge can 
be given without the concurrence of such person, time will run against them all; but, where no such 
discharge can be given, time will not run as against any of them until one of them becomes capable of 
giving such discharge without the concurrence of the others or until the disability has ceased. 
Explanation I.—This section applies to a discharge from every kind of liability, including a liability 
in respect of any immovable property. 
Explanation II.—For the purposes of this section, the Manager of a Hindu undivided family governed 
by the Mitakshara law shall be deemed to be capable of giving a discharge without the concurrence of the 
other members of the family only if he is in management of the joint family property. 
8. Special exceptions.—Nothing in section 6 or in section 7 applies to suits to enforce rights of pre-
emption, or shall be deemed to extend, for more than three years from the cessation of the disability or the 
death of the person affected thereby, the period of limitation for any suit or application. 
9. Continuous running of time.—Where once time has begun to run, no subsequent disability or 
inability to institute a suit or make an application stops it: 
Provided that, where letters of administration to the estate of a creditor have been granted to his 
debtor, the running of the period of limitation for a suit to recover the debt shall be suspended while the 
administration continues. 
10. Suits against trustees and their representatives.—Notwithstanding anything contained in the 
foregoing provisions of this Act, no suit against a person in whom property has become vested in trust for 
any specific purpose, or against his legal representatives or assigns (not being assigns for valuable 
consideration), for the purpose of following in his or their hands such property, or the proceeds thereof, or 
for an account of such property or proceeds, shall be barred by any length of time. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section any property comprised in a Hindu, Muslim or 
Buddhist religious or charitable endowment shall be deemed to be property vested in trust for a specific 
purpose and the manager of the property shall be deemed to be the trustee thereof.

instituted in the territories to which this Act extends on contracts entered into in the State of Jammu and 
Kashmir or in a foreign country shall be subject to the rules of limitation contained in this Act.

be deemed to have been instituted on any earlier date.

been given a reasonable opportunity of making a representation in the matter.  
 
(2) The Collector shall give immediate notice of any correction made in the award to all the persons interested.  
 
(3) Where any excess amount is proved to have been paid to any person as a result of the correction made under sub-

[15A Power to call for records, etc. - The appropriate Government may at any time before the award is made by the 
Collector under section 11 call for any record of any proceedings (whether by way of inquiry or otherwise) for the 
purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any findings or order passed or as to the regularity of 
such proceedings and may pass such order or issue such direction in relation thereto as it may think fit:  
 
Provided that the appropriate Government shall not pass or issue any order or direction prejudicial to any person 
without affording such person a reasonable opportunity of being heard.]  
 
                                                                         Taking Possession

the Collector, though no such award has been made, may, on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of 
the notice mentioned in section 9, sub-section 1). [take possession of any land needed for a public purpose]. Such 
land shall thereupon [vest absolutely in the [Government], free from all encumbrances.

becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the 


[Page 12]
maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river-side or ghat station, or of providing 
convenient connection with or accesses to any such station, [or the appropriate Government considers it necessary to 
acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to 
irrigation, water supply, drainage, road communication or electricity,] the Collector may immediately after the 
publication of the notice mentioned in sub-section (1) and with the previous sanction of the [appropriate 
Government], enter upon and take possession of such land, which shall thereupon [vest absolutely in the 
[Government]] free from all encumbrances :  
 
Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub-section 
without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty-eight hours notice of his intention so to do, or such longer notice 
as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without 
unnecessary inconvenience.  
 
(3) In every case under either of the preceding sub-sections the Collector shall at that time of taking possession offer 
to the persons interested compensation for the standing crops and trees (if any) on such land and from any other 
damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and not excepted in section 24; and, in case such 
offer is not accepted, the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in 
awarding compensation for the land under the provisions herein contained.

interested entitled thereto, and  
 
(b) pay it to them, unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section 31, sub-section 
(2),  
 
and where the Collector is so prevented, the provisions of section 31, sub-section (2), (except the second proviso 
thereto), shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section.  
 
(3B) The amount paid or deposited under section (3A), shall be taken into account for determining the amount of 
compensation required to be tendered under section 31, and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the 
compensation awarded by the Collector under section 11, the excess may, unless refunded within three months from 
the date of Collector's award, be recovered as an arrear of land revenue].  
 
[(4) In the case of any land to which, in the opinion of the [appropriate Government], the provisions of sub-section 
(1) or sub-section (2) are applicable, the [appropriate Government] may direct that the provisions of section 5A shall 
not apply, and, if it does so direct, a declaration may be made under section 6 in respect of the land at any time [after 
the date of the publication of the notification] under section 4, sub-section (1).]

Collector's taking possession of the land.  
 
[(1A) In addition to the market value of the land, as above provided, the Court shall in every case 
award an amount calculated at the rate of twelve per centum per annum on such market value for 
the period commencing on and from the date of the publication of the notification under section 
4, sub-section (1), in respect of such land to the date of the award of the Collector or the date of 
taking possession of the land, whichever is earlier.  
 
Explanation. - In computing the period referred to in this sub-section, any period or periods 
during which the proceedings for the acquisition of the land were held up on account of any stay 
or injunction by the order of any Court shall be excluded.]  
 
(2) In addition to the market value of the land as above provided, the Court shall in every case 
award a sum of [thirty per centum] on such market value, in consideration of the compulsory 
nature of the acquisition.  
 
24. Matters to be neglected in determining compensation. - But the Court shall not take into 
consideration -  
 
first, the degree of urgency which has led to the acquisition;  
 


[Page 15]
secondly, any disinclination of the person interested to part with the land acquired;  
 
thirdly, any damage sustained by him which, if caused by a private person, would not render 
such person liable to a suit;  
 
fourthly, any damage which is likely to be caused to the land acquired, after the date of the 
publication of the declaration under section 6, by or in consequence of the use to which it will be 
put;

27. Costs. - (1) Every such award shall also state the amount of costs incurred in the proceeding 
under this Part, and by what persons and in what proportions they are to be paid.  
 
(2) When the award of the Collector is not upheld, the cost shall ordinarily be paid by the 
Collector, unless the Court shall be opinion that the claim of the applicant was so extravagant or 
that he was so negligent in putting his case before the Collector that some deduction from his 
costs should be made or that he should pay a part of the Collector's costs.  
 
28. Collector may be directed to pay interest on excess compensation. - If the sum, which the 
Collector did award as compensation, the award of the Court may direct that the collector shall

[Provided that the award of the Court may also direct that where such excess or any part thereof 
is paid into Court after the date or expiry of a period of one year from the date on which 
possession is taken, interest at the rate of fifteen per centum per annum shall be payable from the 
date of expiry of the said period of one year on the amount of such excess or part thereof which 
has not been paid into Court before the date of such expiry.]  
 
[28A. Re-determination of the amount of compensation on the basis of the award of the Court. - 
(1) where in an award under this part, the court allows to the applicant any amount of 
compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the collector under section 11, the persons 
interested in all the other land covered by the same notification under section 4, sub-section (1) 
and who are also aggrieved by the award of the Collector may, notwithstanding that they had not 
made an application to the Collector under section 18, by written application to the Collector 
within three months from the date of the award of the Court require that the amount of 
compensation payable to them may be re-determined on the basis of the amount of compensation 
awarded by the court:  
 
Provided that in computing the period of three months within which an application to the 
Collector shall be made under this sub-section, the day on which the award was pronounced and 
the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the award shall be excluded.  
 
(2) The Collector shall, on receipt of an application under sub-section (1), conduct an inquiry 
after giving notice to all the persons interested and giving them a reasonable opportunity of being 
heard, and make an award determining the amount of compensation payable to the applicants.  
 
(3) Any person who has not accepted the award under sub-section (2) may, by written 
application to the Collector, required that the matter be referred by the Collector for the 
determination of the Court and the provisions of sections 18 to 28 shall, so far as may be, apply 
to such reference as they apply to a reference under section 18.]

29. Particulars of apportionment to be specified. - When there are several persons interested, if 
such persons agree in the apportionment of the compensation, the particulars of such 
apportionment shall be specified in the award, and as between such persons the award shall be 
conclusive evidence of the correctness of the apportionment.  
 
30. Dispute as to apportionment. - When the amount of compensation has been settled under 
section 11, if any dispute arises as to the apportionment of the same or any part thereof, or as to 
the persons to whom the same or any part thereof, is payable, the Collector may refer such 
dispute to the decision of the Court.

                                                                             Payment  
 
31. Payment of compensation or deposit of same in Court. - (1) On making an award under 
section 11, the Collector shall tender payment of the compensation awarded by him to the 
persons interested entitled thereto according to the award and shall pay it to them unless 
prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in the next sub-section.  
 
(2) If they shall not consent to receive it, or if there be no person competent to alienate the land, 
or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the compensation or as to the apportionment of 
it, the Collector shall deposit the amount of the compensation in the Court to which a reference 
under section 18 would be submitted:  
 
Provided that any person admitted to be interested may receive such payment under protest as to 
the sufficiency of the amount:  
 
Provided also that no person who has received the amount otherwise than under protest shall be 
entitled to make any application under section 18:  
 
Provided also that nothing herein contained shall affect the liability of any person, who may 
receive the whole or any part of any compensation awarded under this Act, to pay the same to 
the person lawfully entitled thereto.  
 
(3) Notwithstanding anything in this section the Collector may, with the sanction of the 
[appropriate Government] instead of awarding a money compensation in respect of any land, 
make any arrangement with a person having a limited interest in such land, either by the grant of 
other lands in exchange, the remission of land-revenue on other lands held under the same title, 
or in such other way as may be equitable having regard to the interests of the parties concerned.  
 
(4) Nothing in the last foregoing sub-section shall be construed to interfere with or limit the 
power of the Collector to enter into any arrangement with any person interested in the land and 
competent to contract in respect thereof.  
 
32. Investment of money deposited in respect of lands belonging to person incompetent to 
alternate. - (1) If any money shall be deposited in Court under sub-section (2) of the last 
preceding section and it appears that the land in respect whereof the same was awarded belonged 
to any person who had no power to alienate the same, the Court shall-  
 
(a) order the money to be invested in the purchase of other lands to be held under the like title 
and conditions of ownership as the land in respect of which such money shall have been 
deposited was held, or  
 
(b) if such purchase cannot be effected forthwith, then in such Government of other approved 
securities as the Court shall think fit;  
 
and shall direct the payment of the interest or other proceeds arising from such investment to the 
person or persons who would for the time being have been entitled to the possession of the said 


[Page 18]
land, and such moneys shall remain so deposited and invested until the same be applied-  
 
(i) in the purchase of such other lands as aforesaid; or  
 
(ii) in payment to any person or persons becoming absolutely entitled thereto.  
 
(2) In all cases of money deposited to which this section applies the Court shall order the costs of 
the following matters, including therein all reasonable charge and expenses incident thereon, to 
be paid by the Collector, namely: -  
 
(a) the costs of such investments as aforesaid;  
 
(b) the costs of the orders for the payment of the interest or other proceeds of the securities upon 
which such moneys are for the time being invested, and for the payment out of Court of the 
principal of such moneys, and of all proceedings relating thereto, except such as may be 
occasioned by litigation between adverse claimants.  
 
33. Investment of money deposited in other cases. - When any money shall have been deposited 
in Court under this Act for any cause other than mentioned in the last proceeding section, the 
court may, on the application of any party interested or claiming an interest in such money, order 
the same to be invested in such Government or other approved securities as it may think proper, 
and paid in such manner as it may consider will give the parties interested therein the same 
benefit the reform as they might have had from the land in respect whereof such money shall 
have been deposited or as near thereto as may be.  
 
34. Payment of interest - When the amount of such compensation is not paid or deposited on or 
before taking possession of the land, the Collector shall pay the amount awarded with interest 
thereon at the rate of [nine per centum] per annum from the time of so taking possession until it 
shall have been so paid or deposited:  
 
[Provided that if such compensation or any part thereof is not paid or deposited within a period 
of one year from the date on which possession is taken, interest at the rate of fifteen per centum 
per annum shall be payable from the date or expiry of the said period of one year on the amount 
of compensation or part thereof which has not been paid or deposited before the date of such 
expiry.]

35. Temporary occupation of waste or arable land. Procedure when difference as to compensation exists. - (1) 
Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act, whenever it appears to the [appropriate Government] that the 
temporary occupation and use of any waste or arable land are needed for any public purpose, or for a Company, the 
[appropriate Government] may direct the Collector to procure the occupation and use of the same for such term as it 


[Page 19]
shall think fit, not exceeding three years from the commencement of such occupation.  
 
(2) The Collector shall thereupon give notice in writing to the person interested in such land of the purpose for 
which the same is needed, and shall, for the occupation and use thereof for such term as aforesaid, and for the 
materials (if any) to be taken there from, pay to them such compensation, either in a gross sum of money, or by 
monthly or other periodical payments, as shall be agreed upon in writing between him and such persons 
respectively.  
 
(3) In case the Collector and the persons interested differ as to the sufficiency of the compensation or apportionment 
thereof, the Collector shall refer such difference to the decision of the Court.  
 
36. Power to enter and take possession and compensation on restoration. - (1) On payment of such compensation, or 
on executing such agreement, or on making a reference under section 35, the collector may enter upon and take 
possession of the land, and use or permit the use thereof in accordance with the terms of the said notice.  
 
(2) On the expiration of the term, the Collector shall make or tender to the persons interested compensation for the 
damage (if any) done to the land and not provided for by the agreement, and shall restore the land to the persons 
interested therein:  
 
Provided that, if the land has become permanently unfit to be used for the purpose for which it was used 
immediately before the commencement of such term, and if the persons interested shall so require, the [appropriate 
Government] shall proceed under this Act to acquire the land as if it was needed permanently for a public purpose or 
for a Company.  
 
37. Difference as to condition of land. - In case the Collector and persons interested differ as to the condition of the 
land at the expiration of the term, or as to any matter connected with the said agreement, the Collector shall refer 
such difference to the decision of the Court.

CHAPTER III 
LICENSING OF CONDUCTORS OF STAGE CARRIAGES 
29. Necessity for conductor’s licence.—(1) No person shall act as a conductor of a stage carriage 
unless he holds an effective conductor’s licence issued to him authorising him to act as such conductor; 
and no person shall employ or permit any person who is not so licensed to act as a conductor of a stage 
carriage. 
(2) A State Government may prescribe the conditions subject to which sub-section (1) shall not apply 
to a driver of a stage carriage performing the functions of a conductor or to a person employed to act as a 
conductor for a period not exceeding one month. 
30. Grant of conductor’s licence.—(1) Any person who possesses such minimum educational 
qualification as may be prescribed by the State Government and is not disqualified under sub-section (1) 
of section 31 and who is not for the time being disqualified for holding or obtaining a conductor’s licence 
may apply to the licensing authority having jurisdiction in the area in which he ordinarily resides or 
carries on business for the issue to him of a conductor’s licence. 
(2) Every application under sub-section (1) shall be in such form and shall contain such information 
as may be prescribed. 
(3) Every application for a conductor’s licence shall be accompanied by a medical certificate in such 
form as may be prescribed, signed by a registered medical practitioner and shall also be accompanied by 
two clear copies of a recent photograph of the applicant. 
(4) A conductor’s licence issued under this Chapter shall be in such form and contain such particulars 
as may be prescribed and shall be effective throughout the State in which it is issued. 
(5) The fee for a conductor’s licence and for each renewal thereof shall be one-half of that for a 
driving licence. 
31. Disqualifications for the grant of conductor’s licence.—(1) No person under the age of 
eighteen years shall hold, or be granted, a conductor’s licence. 
(2) The licensing authority may refuse to issue a conductor’s licence— 
(a) if the applicant does not possess the minimum educational qualification; 
(b) if the medical certificate produced by the applicant discloses that he is physically unfit to act 
as a conductor; and 
(c) if any previous conductor’s licence held by the applicant was revoked. 
32. Revocation of a conductor’s licence on grounds of disease or disability.—A conductor’s 
licence may at any time be revoked by any licensing authority if that authority has reasonable grounds to 
believe that the holder of the licence is suffering from any disease or disability which is likely to render 
him permanently unfit to hold such a licence and where the authority revoking a conductor’s licence is 
not the authority which issued the same, it shall intimate the fact of such revocation to the authority which 
issued that licence: 
Provided that before revoking any licence, the licensing authority shall give the person holding such 
licence a reasonable opportunity of being heard. 
33. Orders refusing, etc., conductor’s licences and appeals therefrom.—(1) Where a licensing 
authority refuses to issue or renew, or revokes any conductor’s licence, it shall do so by an order 
communicated to the applicant or the holder, as the case may be, giving the reasons in writing for such 
refusal or revocation. 
(2) Any person aggrieved by an order made under sub-section (1) may, within thirty days of the 
service on him of the order, appeal to the prescribed authority which shall decide the appeal after giving 
such person and the authority which made the order an opportunity of being heard and the decision of the 
appellate authority shall be binding on the authority which made the order. 


[Page 29]
29 
 
34. Power of licensing authority to disqualify.—(1) If any licensing authority is of opinion that it is 
necessary to disqualify the holder of a conductor’s licence for holding or obtaining such a licence on 
account of his previous conduct as a conductor, it may, for reasons to be recorded, make an order 
disqualifying that person for a specified period, not exceeding one year, for holding or obtaining a 
conductor’s licence: 
Provided that before disqualifying the holder of a licence, the licensing authority shall give the person 
holding such licence a reasonable opportunity of being heard. 
(2) Upon the issue of any such order, the holder of the conductor’s licence shall forthwith surrender 
the licence to the authority making the order, if the licence has not already been surrendered, and the 
authority shall keep the licence until the disqualification has expired or has been removed. 
(3) Where the authority disqualifying the holder of a conductor’s licence under this section is not the 
authority which issued the licence, it shall intimate the fact of such disqualification to the authority which 
issued the same. 
(4) Any person aggrieved by an order made under sub-section (1) may, within thirty days of the 
service on him of the order, appeal to the prescribed authority which shall decide the appeal after giving 
such person and the authority which made the order an opportunity of being heard and the decision of the 
appellate authority shall be binding on the authority which made the order. 
35. Power of Court to disqualify.—(1) Where any person holding a conductor’s licence is convicted 
of an offence under this Act, the Court by which such person is convicted may, in addition to imposing 
any other punishment authorised by law, declare the person so convicted to be disqualified for such 
period as the Court may specify for holding a conductor’s licence. 
(2) The Court to which an appeal lies from any conviction of an offence under this Act may set aside 
or vary any order of disqualification made by the Court below, and the Court to which appeals ordinarily 
lie from such Court, may set aside or vary any order of disqualification made by that Court, 
notwithstanding that no appeal lies against the conviction in connection with which such order was made. 
36. Certain provisions of Chapter II to apply to conductor’s licence.—The provisions of  
sub-section (2) of section 6, sections 14, 15 and 23, sub-section (1) of section 24 and section 25 shall, so 
far as may be, apply in relation to a conductor’s licence, as they apply in relation to a driving licence. 
37. Savings.—If any licence to act as a conductor of a stage carriage (by whatever name called) has 
been issued in any State and is effective immediately before the commencement of this Act, it shall 
continue to be effective, notwithstanding such commencement, for the period for which it would have 
been effective, if this Act had not been passed, and every such licence shall be deemed to be a licence 
issued under this Chapter as if this Chapter had been in force on the date on which that licence was 
granted. 
38. Power of State Government to make rules.—(1) A State Government may make rules for the 
purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Chapter.

registered post acknowledgement due at his address entered in the certificate of registration), and for 
reasons to be recorded in writing, cancel the registration.

by the variation, extension or curtailment of the route or routes or the area specified in the permit shall be 
treated as an application for the grant of a new permit: 
Provided that it shall not be necessary so to treat an application made by the holder of stage carriage 
permit who provides the only service on any route to increase the frequency of the service so provided 
without any increase in the number of vehicles:  
Provided further that,— 
(i) in the case of variation, the termini shall not be altered and the distance covered by the 
variation shall not exceed twenty-four kilometres; 
(ii) in the case of extension, the distance covered by extension shall not exceed twenty-four 
kilometres from the termini, 
and any such variation or extension within such limits shall be made only after the transport authority is 
satisfied that such variation will serve the convenience of the public and that it is not expedient to grant a 
separate permit in respect of the original route as so varied or extended or any part thereof. 
(4) A 1[Regional Transport Authority, State Transport Authority or any prescribed authority referred 
to in sub-section (1) of section 66] may, before such date as may be specified by it in this behalf, replace 
any permit granted by it before the said date by a fresh permit conforming to the provisions of section 72 
or section 74 or section 76 or section 79, as the case may be, and the fresh permit shall be valid for the 
same route or routes or the same area for which the replaced permit was valid: 
Provided that no condition other than a condition which was already attached to the replaced permit 
or which could have been attached thereto under the law in force when that permit was granted shall be 
attached to the fresh permit except with the consent in writing of the holder of the permit. 
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 81, a permit issued under the provisions of  
sub-section (4) shall be effective without renewal for the remainder of the period during which the 
replaced permit would have been so effective. 
81. Duration and renewal of permits.—(1) A permit other than a temporary permit issued under 
section 87 or a special permit issued under sub-section (8) of section 88 shall be effective 2[from the date 
of issuance or renewal thereof] for a period of five years: 
Provided that where the permit is countersigned under sub-section (1) of section 88, such 
countersignature shall remain effective without renewal for such period so as to synchronise with the 
validity of the primary permit. 
(2) A permit may be renewed on an application made not less than fifteen days before the date of its 
expiry. 
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), the Regional Transport Authority or the 
State Transport Authority, as the case may be, may entertain an application for the renewal of a permit 
after the last date specified in that sub-section if it is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by good 
and sufficient cause from making an application within the time specified. 
(4) The Regional Transport Authority or the State Transport Authority, as the case may be, may reject 
an application for the renewal of a permit on one or more of the following grounds, namely:— 
 
1. Subs. by Act 54 of 1994, s. 25, for “Regional Transport Authority” (w.e.f. 14-11-1994).

stayed by the order of an appellate authority shall not be taken into account: 
Provided further that no application under this sub-section shall be rejected unless an opportunity of 
being heard is given to the applicant.

renewal shall have effect from the date of such expiry irrespective of whether or not a temporary permit 
has been granted under clause (d) of section 87, and where a temporary permit has been granted, the fee 
paid in respect of such temporary permit shall be refunded. 
82. Transfer of permit.—(1) Save as provided in sub-section (2), a permit shall not be transferable

(2) Where the holder of a permit dies, the person succeeding to the possession of the vehicle covered

holder of a permit, transfer the permit to the person succeeding to the possession of the vehicles covered 
by the permit:

period of three months if it is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by good and sufficient cause from 
making an application within the time specified.

holder of the permit to furnish his explanation. 
(2) The transport authority may exercise the powers conferred on it under sub-section (1) in relation 
to a permit granted by any authority or person to whom power in this behalf has been delegated under

(3) Where a transport authority cancels or suspends a permit, it shall give to the holder in writing its 
reasons for the action taken.

powers have been delegated under sub-section (5) of section 68. 
(5) Where a permit is liable to be cancelled or suspended under clause (a) or clause (b) or clause (e) 
of sub-section (1) and the transport authority is of opinion that having regard to the circumstances of the 
case, it would not be necessary or expedient so to cancel or suspend the permit if the holder of the permit 
agrees to pay a certain sum of money, then, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the 
transport authority may, instead of cancelling or suspending the permit, as the case may be, recover from 
the holder of the permit the sum of money agreed upon.

thereunder in respect of any route or area where— 
(i) no permit could be issued under section 72 or section 74 or section 76 or section 79 in respect 
of that route or area by reason of an order of a court or other competent authority restraining the issue 
of the same, for a period not exceeding the period for which the issue of the permit has been so 
restrained; or 
(ii) as a result of the suspension by a court or other competent authority of the permit of any 
vehicle in respect of that route or area, there is no transport vehicle of the same class with a valid 
permit in respect of that route or area, or there is no adequate number of such vehicles in respect of 
that route or area, for a period not exceeding the period of such suspension: 
Provided that the number of transport vehicles in respect of which temporary permits are so granted

Provided further that where both the starting point and the terminal point of a route are situate within 
the same State, but part of such route lies in any other State and the length of such part does not exceed

in that other State notwithstanding that such permit has not been countersigned by the State Transport 
Authority or the Regional Transport Authority of that other State: 
Provided also that— 
(a) where a motor vehicle covered by a permit granted in one State is to be used for the purposes

 Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, a person driving a motor vehicle merely as a paid 
employee, while there is in relation to the use of the vehicle no such policy in force as is required by this 
sub-section, shall not be deemed to act in contravention of the sub-section unless he knows or has reason

or injured or the property which is damaged was not in a public place at the time of the accident, if 
the act or omission which led to the accident occurred in a public place. 
 (2) Notwithstanding anything contained under any other law for the time being in force, for the 
purposes of third party insurance related to either death of a person or grievous hurt to a person, the 
Central Government shall prescribe a base premium and the liability of an insurer in relation to such 
premium for an insurance policy under sub-section (1) in consultation with the Insurance Regulatory 
and Development Authority. 
(3) A policy shall be of no effect for the purposes of this Chapter unless and until there is issued 
by the insurer in favour of the person by whom the policy is effected, a certificate of insurance in the 
prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars of any condition subject to which the policy 
is issued and of any other prescribed matters; and different forms, particulars and matters may be 
prescribed in different cases. 
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, a policy of Insurance issued before the

with the requirements of the law of insurance for the time being in force in that country, then, 
notwithstanding anything contained in section 147 but subject to any rules which may be made under 
section 164B such policy of insurance shall be effective throughout the route or area in respect of which 
the arrangement has been made, as if the policy of insurance had complied with the requirements of this 
Chapter. 
 


[Page 87]
87 
 
149. Settlement by insurance company and procedure therefor. — (1) The insurance company 
shall, upon receiving information of the accident, either from claimant or through accident information 
report or otherwise, designate an officer to settle the claims relating to such accident.

(a) accepts such offer,— 
(i) the Claims Tribunal shall make a record of such settlement, and such claim shall be 
deemed to be settled by consent; and 
(ii) the payment shall be made by the insurance company within a maximum period of thirty 
days from the date of receipt of such record of settlement; 
(b) rejects such offer, a date of hearing shall be fixed by the Claims Tribunal to adjudicate such 
claim on merits. 
 
150. Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments and awards against persons insured in respect of 
third party risks. — (1) If, after a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub-section (3) of 
section 147 in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected, judgment or award in respect of 
any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 
147 (being a liability covered by the terms of the policy) or under the provisions of section 164 is 
obtained against any person insured by the policy, then, notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled 
to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy, the insurer shall, subject to the provisions 
of this section, pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the award any sum not exceeding the sum 
assured payable thereunder, as if that person were the decree holder, in respect of the liability, together 
with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by 
virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments. 
(2) No sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub-section (1) in respect of any judgment or award 
unless, before the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment or award is given the insurer 
had notice through the court or, as the case may be, the Claims Tribunal of the bringing of the 
proceedings, or in respect of such judgment or award so long as its execution is stayed pending an appeal; 
and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be 
made a party thereto, and to defend the action on any of the following grounds, namely:— 
(a) that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy, being one of the following 
conditions, namely:–– 
(i) a condition excluding the use of the vehicle— 
(A) for hire or reward, where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle

(iii) a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war, civil 
war, riot or civil commotion; or 
(b) that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by nondisclosure of any material fact or 
by representation of any fact which was false in some material particular; or 
(c) that there is non-receipt of premium as required under section 64VB of the Insurance Act, 1938   
(4 of 1938).  
(3) Where any such judgment or award as is referred to in sub-section (1) is obtained from a court in a 
reciprocating country and in the case of a foreign judgment is, by virtue of the provisions of section 13 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) conclusive as to any matter adjudicated upon by it, the 
insurer (being an insurer registered under the Insurance Act, 1938 (4 of 1938) and whether or not that 


[Page 88]
88 
 
person is registered under the corresponding law of the reciprocating country) shall be liable to the person 
entitled to the benefit of the decree in the manner and to the extent specified in sub-section (1), as if the 
judgment or award were given by a court in India: 
Provided that no sum shall be payable by the insurer in respect of any such judgment or award unless, 
before the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment or award is given, the insurer had 
notice through the court concerned of the bringing of the proceedings and the insurer to whom notice is so 
given is entitled under the corresponding law of the reciprocating country, to be made a party to the 
proceedings and to defend the action on grounds similar to those specified in sub-section (2). 
(4) Where a certificate of insurance has been issued under sub-section (3) of section 147 to the person 
by whom a policy has been effected, so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the 
persons insured thereby, by reference to any condition other than those in sub-section (2) shall, as 
respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of 
section 147, be of no effect. 
(5) No insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) has been given 
shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment or award 
as is referred to in sub-section (1) or in such judgment as is referred to in sub-section (3) otherwise than in 
the manner provided for in sub-section (2) or in the corresponding law of the reciprocating country, as the 
case may be. 
(6) If on the date of filing of any claim, the claimant is not aware of the insurance company with 
which the vehicle had been insured, it shall be the duty of the owner of the vehicle to furnish to the 
tribunal or court the information as to whether the vehicle had been insured on the date of the accident, 
and if so, the name of the insurance company with which it is insured. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section,— 
(a) “award” means an award made by the Claims Tribunal under section 168; 
(b) “Claims Tribunal” means a Claims Tribunal constituted under section 165; 
(c) “liability covered by the terms of the policy” means the liability which is covered by the 
policy or which would be so covered but for the fact that the insurer is entitled to avoid or cancel or 
has avoided or cancelled the policy; and 
(d) “material fact” and “material particular” mean, respectively, a fact or particular of such a 
nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in determining whether he shall take the risk 
and, if so, at what premium and on what conditions. 
151. Rights of third party against insurers on insolvency of insured. — (1) Where under any 
contract of insurance affected in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, a person is insured 
against liabilities which he may incur to third party, then—  
(a) in the event of the person becoming insolvent or making a composition or arrangement with 
his creditors; or 
 (b) where the insured person is a company, in the event of a winding-up order being made or a 
resolution for a voluntary winding-up being passed with respect to the company or of a receiver or 
manager of the company’s business or undertaking being duly appointed, or of possession being taken 
by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by a floating charge of any property 
comprised in or subject to the charge,  
if, either before or after that event, any such liability is incurred by the insured person his rights against 
the insurer under the contract in respect of the liability shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
any provision of law, be transferred to and vest in the third party to whom the liability was so incurred.  
(2) Where an order for the administration of the estate of a deceased debtor is made according to the 
law of insolvency, then, if any debt provable in insolvency is owing by the deceased in respect of a 
liability to a third party against which he was insured under a contract of insurance in accordance with the 
provisions of this Chapter, the deceased debtor’s rights against the insurer in respect of that liability shall, 
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any provision of law, be transferred to and vest in the person 
to whom the debt is owing. 
(3) Any condition in a policy issued for the purposes of this Chapter purporting, either directly or 
indirectly, to avoid the policy or to alter the rights of the parties thereunder upon the happening to the 
insured person of any of the events specified in clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) or upon the                     
making of an order for the administration of the estate of a deceased debtor according to the law of 
insolvency, shall be of no effect.  


[Page 89]
89 
 
(4) Upon a transfer under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), the insurer shall be under the same 
liability to the third party as he would have been to the insured person, but— 
 (a) if the liability of the insurer to the insured person exceeds the liability of the insured person to 
the third party, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights of the insured person against the insurer 
in respect of the excess amount; and  
(b) if the liability of the insurer to the insured person is less than the liability of the insured person 
to the third party, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights of the third party against the insured 
person in respect of the balance amount. 
152. Duty to give information as to insurance. —(1) No person against whom a claim is made in 
respect of any liability referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 147 shall, on demand by or on 
behalf of the person making the claim, refuse to state whether or not he was insured in respect of that 
liability by any policy issued under the provisions of this Chapter, or would have been so insured if the 
insurer had not avoided or cancelled the policy, nor shall he refuse, if he was or would have been so 
insured, to give such particulars with respect to that policy as were specified in the certificate of insurance 
issued in respect thereof.  
(2) In the event of any person becoming insolvent or making an arrangement with his creditors or in 
the event of an order being made for the administration of the estate of a deceased person according to the 
law of insolvency, or in the event of a winding-up order being made or a resolution for a voluntary 
winding-up being passed with respect to any company or of a receiver or manager of the company’s 
business or undertaking being duly appointed or of possession being taken by or on behalf of the holders 
of any debentures secured by a floating charge on any property comprised in or subject to the charge, it 
shall be the duty of the insolvent debtor, personal representative of the deceased debtor or company, as 
the case may be, or the official assignee or receiver in insolvency, trustee, liquidator, receiver or manager, 
or person in possession of the property to give, on the request of any person claiming that the insolvent 
debtor, deceased debtor or company is under such liability to him as is covered by the provision of this 
Chapter, such information as may reasonably be required by him for the purpose of ascertaining whether 
any rights have been transferred to and vested in him by section 151 and for the purpose of enforcing such 
rights, if any, and any such contract of insurance as purports whether directly or indirectly to avoid the 
contract or to alter the rights of the parties thereunder upon the giving of such information in the events 
aforesaid, or otherwise to prohibit or prevent the giving thereof in the said events, shall be of no effect.  
(3) If, from the information given to any person in pursuance of sub-section (2) or otherwise, he has 
reasonable ground for supporting that there have or may have been transferred to him under this Chapter 
rights against any particular insurer, that insurer shall be subject to the same duty as is imposed by the 
said sub-section on the persons therein mentioned. 
(4) The duty to give the information imposed by this section shall include a duty to allow all contracts 
of insurance, receipts for premiums, and other relevant documents in the possession or power of the 
person on whom the duty is so imposed to be inspected and copies thereof to be taken. 
153. Settlement between insurers and insured persons. — (1) No settlement made by an insurer in 
respect of any claim which might be made by a third party in respect of any liability of the nature referred 
to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 147 shall be valid unless such third party is a party to the 
settlement. 
(2) The Claims Tribunal shall ensure that the settlement is bona fide and was not made under undue 
influence and the compensation is made in accordance with the payment schedule referred to in                     
sub-section (1) of section 164. 
 (3) Where a person who is insured under a policy issued for the purpose of this Chapter has become 
insolvent, or where, if such insured person is a company, a winding-up order has been made or a 
resolution for a voluntary winding-up has been passed with respect to the company, no agreement made 
between the insurer and the insured person after the liability has been incurred to a third party and after 
the commencement of the insolvency or winding-up, as the case may be, nor any waiver, assignment or 
other disposition made by or payment made to the insured person after the commencement aforesaid, 


[Page 90]
90 
 
shall be effective to defeat the rights transferred to the third party under this Chapter; but those rights 
shall be the same as if no such agreement, waiver, assignment or disposition or payment has been made. 
154. Saving in respect of sections 151, 152 and 153. — (1) For the purposes of sections 151, 152 
and 153, a reference to “liabilities to third parties” in relation to a person insured under any policy of 
insurance shall not include a reference to any liability of that person in the capacity of insurer under some 
other policy of insurance. 
(2) The provisions of sections 151, 152 and 153 shall not apply where a company is wound-up 
voluntarily merely for the purposes of reconstruction or of an amalgamation with another company. 
155. Effect of death on certain causes of action. —Notwithstanding anything contained in section 
306 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, (39 of 1925) the death of a person in whose favour a certificate 
of insurance had been issued, if it occurs after the happening of an event which has given rise to a claim 
under the provisions of this Chapter, shall not be a bar to the survival of any cause of action arising out of 
such event against his estate or against the insurer. 
156. Effect of certificate of insurance. — When an insurer has issued a certificate of insurance in 
respect of a contract of insurance between the insurer and the insured person, then—

(b) may, by a specified date prior to the hearing of the charge, plead guilty to the charge and remit 
to the Court, by money order, such sum (not exceeding the maximum fine that may be imposed for

itself: 
Provided that the Court shall, in the case of any of the offences referred to in sub-section (2), state

(b) such failure was brought about by the conduct of the accused. 
210. Courts to send intimation about conviction.—Every Court by which any person holding a

STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS 
The Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (4 of 1939), consolidates and amends the law relating to motor 
vehicles. This has been amended several times to keep it up to date. The need was, however, felt that this 
Act should, now inter aria, take into account also changes in the road transport technology, pattern of 
passenger and freight movements, development of the road network in the country and particularly the 
improve techniques in the motor vehicles management. 
2. Various Committees like National Transport Policy Committee, National Police Commission, Road 
Safety Committee, Low Powered Two-wheelers Committee, as also the Law Commission have gone into 
different aspects of road transport. They have recommended updating, simplification and rationalization 
of this law. Several Members of Parliament have also urged for comprehensive review of the Motor 
Vehicles Act, 1939, to make it relevant to the modern-day requirements. 
3. A Working Group was, therefore, constituted in January, 1984 to review all the provisions of the 
Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and to submit draft proposals for a comprehensive legislation to replace the 
existing Act. This Working Group took into account the suggestions and recommendations earlier made 
by various bodies and institutions like Central Institute of Road Transport Automotive Research 
Association of India, and other transport organisations including the manufacturers and the general 
public. Besides obtaining comments of State Governments on the recommendations of the Working 
Group, these were discussed in a specially convened meeting of Transport Ministers of all States and 
Union territories. Some of the more important modifications so suggested related for taking care of- 
(a) the fast increasing number of both commercial vehicles and personal vehicles in the country; 
(b) the need for encouraging adoption of higher technology in automotive sector; 
(c) the greater flow of passenger and freight with the least impediments so that islands of isolations 
are not created leading to regional or local imbalances; 
(d) concern for road safety standards, and pollution-control measures, standards for transportation 
of hazardous and explosive materials; 
(e) simplification of procedure and policy liberalizations for private sector operations in the road 
transport field; and 
(f) need for effective ways of tracking down traffic offenders. 
4. The Supreme Court in M. K. Kunhimohammed vs. P. A. Ahmedkutty, A.I.R. 1937 S.C. page 2158, 
has made certain suggestions to raise the limit of compensation payable as a result of motor accidents is 
respect of death and permanent disablement in the event of there being no proof of fault on the part of the 
person involved in the accident and also in hit and run motor accidents and remove certain disparities in 
the liability of the insurer to pay compensation depending upon the class or type of vehicles involved in 
the accident. The above suggestions made by the Supreme Court have been incorporated in the Bill. 
5. The proposed legislation has been prepared in the light of the above background. Some of the more 
important provisions of the Bill provide for the following matters, namely:— 
(a) rationalization of certain definitions with additions of certain new definitions of new types of 
vehicles: 
(b) stricter procedures relating to grant of driving licences and the period of validity thereof; 
(c) laying down of standards for the components and parts of motor vehicles; 
(d) standards for anti-pollution control devices; 
(e) provision for issuing fitness certificates of vehicles also by the authorised testing stations; 
(f) enabling provision for updating the system of registration marks; 
(g) liberalised schemes for grant of stage carriage permits on non-nationalised routes, all-India 
Tourist permits and also national permits for goods carriages; 
(h) administration of the Solatium Scheme by the General Insurance Corporation; 


[Page 158]
158 
 
(i) Provision for enhanced compensation in cases of "no fault liability" and in hit and run motor 
accidents; 
(j) provision for payment of compensation by the insurer to the extent of actual liability to the 
victims of motor accidents irrespective of the class of vehicles; 
(k) maintenance of State registers for driving licences and vehicle registration: 
(l) constitution of Road Safety Councils. 
6. The Bill also seeks to provide for more deterrent punishment in the cases of certain offences. 
7. The Notes on clauses explain the provisions of the Bill. 
8. The Bill seeks achieve the above objectives.

and such permission shall be granted subject to the conditions and on payment of the rent and other 
charges by issuing permit in the form as may be prescribed: 
Provided that no such permission shall be valid beyond a period of one month at a time from the date

Highway Administration. 
25. Grant of lease or licence of highway land for temporary use.—The Highway Administration 
or the officer authorised by such Administration in this behalf may, having regard to the safety and 
convenience of traffic and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed and on payment of prescribed 
rent or other charges, grant lease or licence of highway land to a person for temporary use: 
Provided that no such lease shall be valid for more than five years at a time from the date on which 
such lease has been granted unless renewed by the Highway Administration or such officer. 
26. Removal of unauthorised occupation.—(1) Where the Highway Administration or the officer 
authorised by such Administration in this behalf is of the opinion that it is necessary in the interest of 
traffic safety or convenience to cancel any permit issued under sub-section (2) of section 24, it may, after 
recording the reasons in writing for doing so, cancel such permit and, thereupon, the person to whom the 
permission was granted shall, within the period specified by an order made by the Highway 
Administration or such officer restore the portion of the Highway specified in the permit in such condition 
as it was immediately before the issuing of such permit and deliver the possession of such portion to the 
Highway Administration and in case such person fails to deliver such possession within such period, he 
shall be deemed to be in unauthorised occupation of highway land for the purposes of this section and 
section 27. 
 (2) When, as a result of the periodical inspection of highway land or otherwise, the Highway 
Administration or the officer authorised by such Administration in this behalf is satisfied that any 
unauthorised occupation has taken place on highway land, the Highway Administration or the officer so 


[Page 8]
8 
 
authorised shall serve a notice in a prescribed form on the person causing or responsible for such 
unauthorised occupation requiring him to remove such unauthorised occupation and to restore such 
highway land in its original condition as before the unauthorised occupation within the period specified in 
the notice. 
(3) The notice under sub-section (2) shall specify therein the highway land in respect of which such 
notice is issued, the period within which the unauthorised occupation on such land is required to be 
removed, the place and time of hearing any representation, if any, which the person to whom the notice is 
addressed may make within the time specified in the notice and that failure to comply with such notice 
shall render the person specified in the notice liable to penalty, and summary eviction from the highway 
land in respect of which such notice is issued, under sub-section (6). 
(4) The service of the notice under sub-section (2) shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to the 
person to whom such notice is addressed or to his agent or other person on his behalf or by registered post 
addressed to the person to whom such notice is addressed and an acknowledgment purporting to be signed 
by such person or his agent or other person on his behalf or an endorsement by a postal employee that 
such person or his agent or such other person on his behalf has refused to take delivery may be deemed to 
be prima facie proof of service. 
(5) Where the service of the notice is not made in the manner provided under sub-section (4), the 
contents of the notice shall be advertised in a local newspaper for the knowledge of the person to whom 
the notice is addressed and such advertisement shall be deemed to be the service of such notice on such 
person. 
(6) Where the service of notice under sub-section (2) has been made under sub-section (4) or  
sub-section (5) and the unauthorised occupation on the highway land in respect of which such notice is 
served has not been removed within the time specified in the notice for such purpose and no reasonable 
cause has been shown before the Highway Administration or the officer authorised by such 
Administration in this behalf for not so removing unauthorised occupation, the Highway Administration 
or such officer, as the case may be, shall cause such unauthorised occupation to be removed at the 
expenses of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, and impose penalty on 
the person to whom the notice is addressed which shall be five hundred rupees per square metre of the 
land so unauthorisedly occupied and where the penalty so imposed is less than the cost of such land, the 
penalty may be extended equal to such cost.  
(7) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the Highway Administration or the officer 
authorised by such Administration in this behalf shall have power without issuing any notice under this 
section to remove the unauthorised occupation on the highway land, if such unauthorised occupation is in 
the nature of— 
(a) exposing any goods or article— 
(i) in open air; or 
(ii) through temporary stall, kiosk, booth or any other shop of temporary nature, 
(b) construction or erection, whether temporary or permanent, or 
(c) trespass or other unauthorised occupation which can be removed easily without use of any 
machine or other device, 
and in removing such occupation, the Highway Administration or such officer may take assistance of the 
police, if necessary, to remove such occupation by use of the reasonable force necessary for such 
removal. 
(8) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, if the Highway Administration or the officer 
authorised by such Administration in this behalf is of the opinion that any unauthorised occupation on the 
highway land is of such a nature that the immediate removal of which is necessary in the interest of— 
(a) the safety of traffic on the Highway; or 
(b) the safety of any structure forming part of the Highway, 


[Page 9]
9 
 
and no notice can be served on the person responsible for such unauthorised occupation under this section 
without undue delay owing to his absence or for any other reason, the Highway Administration or the 
officer authorised by such Administration may make such construction including alteration of any 
construction as may be feasible at the prescribed cost necessary for the safety referred to in clause (a) or 
clause (b) or have such unauthorised occupation removed in the manner specified in sub-section (7). 
(9) The Highway Administration or an officer authorised by such Administration in this behalf shall, 
for the purposes of this section or section 27, have the same powers as are vested in a civil court under the 
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), while trying a suit, in respect of the following matters, 
namely:—

Highway or such part thereof to all traffic or to any class of traffic, or regulate the number and speed of 


[Page 11]
11 
 
vehicles to be used on the Highway or such part thereof, as the case may be, in the manner as it may deem 
fit.

conditions as may be specified in the notification, the use of any Highway or part thereof by a class or 
classes of traffic either generally or on specified occasion or time as specified in the notification and when 
such prohibition or restriction is imposed, the Highway Administration shall cause such traffic signs to be 
placed or erected at suitable places for the convenience of the traffic as may be prescribed: 
Provided that where any prohibition or restriction under this section is to be remained for a period of 
one month or less, such prohibition or restriction may be imposed without issuing notification in the 
Official Gazette: 
Provided further that the prohibition or restriction imposed under the first proviso shall be published 
widely for the knowledge of the users by other possible means.

possession of, any vehicle or animal shall, wilfully or negligently, cause, or allow such vehicle or animal 
to cause, any damage to any Highway.

Highway Administration shall have such damage repaired at its own expenses and such expenses together 
with fifteen per cent. thereof as additional charges shall, without prejudice to any other action which may 
be taken against the person who has so contravened sub-section (1), be recovered from him in accordance

under the application where the land can be found to locate the public utility, it may give permission in 
writing as sought in the application: 
Provided that while giving such permission, the Highway Administration may impose such 
conditions as it may deem fit to protect— 
(i) the Highway from damage; and

6Magistrate or by the 7*** Commissioner of Police of a Presidency-town. 
3. Power to refuse license.—The Magistrate or 7*** Commissioner of Police to whom the 
application for a license of a stage-carriage is made may refuse to license the same, if he shall be of 
opinion that such stage-carriage is unserviceable or is unsafe or unfit for public accommodation or

Particulars of license.—If a Magistrate or 7*** Commissioner of Police as aforesaid shall grant a 
license, the license shall set forth the number thereof, the name and residence of the proprietor of the

insurer shall make application therefore to the Central Government in Form 55. 
(2) The Central Government may, if it is satisfied that the application referred to in sub- 
rule (1) is in order and that it is expedient that the foreign insurer be placed in the 
approved list or, where the name of the foreign insurer is already included in the 
approved list, that the insurer should be added to the approved list as guarantor of the 
foreign insurer, and the name of the foreign insurer to the approved list if it is not already

Provided that the insurer shall be deemed, in respect of all certificates of foreign insurance 
endorsed or renewed in accordance with the provisions of sub-rule (2) of rule 161 before the

certificate as if the guarantor had not ceased to be his guarantor. 
(4) If at any time a guarantor ceases to be an insurer, the Central Government may, after 
giving such  notice as may appear to it to be necessary, remove from the approved list the 
name of such guarantor wherever it appears: 
Provided that the guarantor who ceases to be an insurer shall be deemed, in respect of all 
certificates of foreign insurance endorsed in pursuance of the provisions of sub-rule (2) of 
rule 161 before the date of removal of the name of the guarantor from the approved

for the purpose of endorsement in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter or for the 
purpose of the renewal of any endorsement already made on the certificate in accordance 
with this Chapter. 
(2) Such officer shall, if satisfied that the certificate of foreign insurance complies with 
the requirements of the provisions of this Chapter, that the period of validity of such 
certificate in India has not expired, that the certificate has been issued by a foreign 
insurer in the approved list and that the guarantor specified in the certificate is shown in the 
approved list as a guarantor of the foreign insurer, make an endorsement thereon in Form 58. 
(3) The period of validity of an endorsement or of the renewal of an endorsement made as 
aforesaid shall not in any case extend beyond the date on which the certificate of foreign 
insurance ceases to be effective in India: 
Provided that when a visitor obtains a fresh certificate of foreign insurance during the 
period of his stay in India, the period of validity of an endorsement made upon it added to 
the period of validity of an endorsement or endorsements that may have been made upon 
the original certificate, shall not exceed one year in all.

162.  
Validity of certificate of foreign insurance.— A certificate of foreign insurance 
carrying an endorsement in accordance with the provisions of rule 161 shall have effect as if 
it were a certificate of insurance issued by the guarantor specified in it and shall be deemed

relates shall also be deemed to have been issued by such guarantor and to comply with 
the requirements of Chapter XI of the Act. 
 
163.   Maintenance of records by the guarantor.—Every guarantor shall in respect of 
certificates of foreign insurance issued under his guarantee by the foreign insurer whom he 
has guaranteed and every person who has ceased to be a guarantor shall, in respect of the

had guaranteed at any time in the preceding five years, keep a record of such particulars 
relating to the policies in connection with which the certificates of foreign insurance 
were issued as are required to be kept by insurers under the provisions of rule 147 in respect 
of policies, and the necessary additions to those records required to make them up to date 
shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible in the circumstances.

(a) after the expiry of six months from the date of dispossession; or 
(b) against the Government. 
(3) No appeal shall lie from any order or decree passed in any suit instituted under this section, nor

7. Recovery of specific movable property.—A person entitled to the possession of specific movable 
property may recover it in the manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 
Explanation 1.—A trustee may sue under this section for the possession of movable property to the 
beneficial interest in which the person for whom he is trustee is entitled. 
Explanation 2.—A special or temporary right to the present possession of movable property is sufficient 
to support a suit under this section. 
8. Liability of person in possession, not as owner, to deliver to persons entitled to immediate 
possession.—Any person having the possession or control of a particular article of movable property, of 
which he is not the owner, may be compelled specifically to deliver it to the person entitled to its immediate 
possession, in any of the following cases:— 
(a) when the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the plaintiff; 
(b) when compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate relief for the loss of the 
thing claimed;

(d) when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the plaintiff. 
Explanation.—Unless and until the contrary is proved, the court shall, in respect of any article of 
movable property claimed under clause (b) or clause (c) of this section, presume— 
(a) that compensation in money would not afford the plaintiff adequate relief for the loss of the 
thing claimed, or, as the case may be; 
(b) that it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss. 
CHAPTER II 
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS 
9. Defences respecting suits for relief based on contract.—Except as otherwise provided herein 
where any relief is claimed under this Chapter in respect of a contract, the person against whom the relief

1[10. Specific performance in respect of contracts.—The specific performance of a contract shall be 
enforced by the court subject to the provisions contained in sub-section (2) of section 11, section 14 and 
section 16.] 
 
 
                                                          
1. Subs. by Act 18 of 2018, s 3, for section 10 (w.e.f. 1-10-2018). 


[Page 6]
6 
 
11. Cases in which specific performance of contracts connected with trusts enforceable.—(1) 
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, specific performance of a 1[contract shall], be enforced when the 
act agreed to be done is in the performance wholly or partly of a trust. 
(2) A contract made by a trustee in excess of his powers or in breach of trust cannot be specifically 
enforced. 
12. Specific performance of part of contract.—(1) Except as otherwise hereinafter provided in this 
section, the court shall not direct the specific performance of a part of a contract. 
(2) Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, but the part which must 
be left unperformed be a only a small proportion to the whole in value and admits of compensation in 
money, the court may, at the suit of either party, direct the specific performance of so much of the contract 
as can be performed, and award compensation in money for the deficiency. 
(3) Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, and the part which must 
be left unperformed either— 
(a) forms a considerable part of the whole, though admitting of compensation in money; or 
(b) does not admit of compensation in money; 
he is not entitled to obtain a decree for specific performance; but the court may, at the suit of the other party, 
direct the party in default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can perform, if 
the other party— 
(i) in a case falling under clause (a), pays or has paid the agreed consideration for the whole of the 
contract reduced by the consideration for the part which must be left unperformed and in a case falling 
under clause (b) 2[pays or has paid] the consideration for the whole of the contract without any 
abatement; and 
(ii) in either case, relinquishes all claims to the performance of the remaining part of the contract 
and all right to compensation, either for the deficiency or for the loss or damage sustained by him 
through the default of the defendant. 
(4) When a part of a contract which, taken by itself, can and ought to be specifically performed, stands 
on a separate and independent footing from another part of the same contract which cannot or ought not to 
be specifically performed, the court may direct specific performance of the former part. 
Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, a party to a contract shall be deemed to be unable to 
perform the whole of his part of it if a portion of its subject-matter existing at the date of the contract has 
ceased to exist at the time of its performance. 
13. Rights of purchaser or lessee against person with no title or imperfect title.—(1) Where a 
person contracts to sell or let certain immovable property having no title or only an imperfect title, the 
purchaser or lessee (subject to the other provisions of this Chapter), has the following rights, namely:— 
(a) if the vendor or lessor has subsequently to the contract acquired any interest in the property, the 
purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good the contract out of such interest; 
(b) where the concurrence of other person is necessary for validating the title, and they are bound 
to concur at the request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such 
concurrence, and when a conveyance by other persons is necessary to validate the title and they are 
bound to convey at the request of the vendor or lessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to 
procure such conveyance; 
(c) where the vendor professes to sell unencumbered property, but the property is mortgaged for an 
amount not exceeding the purchase money and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, the 
purchaser may compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a valid discharge, and, where 
necessary, also a conveyance from the mortgagee; 
                                                          
1. Subs. by Act 18 of 2018, s. 4, for “contract may, in the discretion of the court” (w.e.f. 1-10-2018). 
2. Ins. by Act 52 of 1964, s. 3 and the Second Schedule (w.e.f. 29-12-1964). 


[Page 7]

(d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract and the suit is dismissed 
on the ground of his want of title or imperfect title, the defendant has a right to a return of his deposit, 
if any, with interest thereon, to his costs of the suit, and to a lien for such deposit, interest and costs on 
the interest, if any, of the vendor or lesser in the property which is the subject-matter of the contract. 
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall also apply, as far as may be, to contracts for the sale or hire 
of movable property. 
CONTRACTS WHICH CANNOT BE SPECIFICALLY ENFORCED 
1[14. Contracts not specifically enforceable.—The following contracts cannot be specifically 
enforced, namely:— 
(a) where a party to the contract has obtained substituted performance of contract in accordance with 
the provisions of section 20; 
(b) a contract, the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the 
court cannot supervise; 
(c) a contract which is so dependent on the personal qualifications of the parties that the court cannot 
enforce specific performance of its material terms; and 
(d) a contract which is in its nature determinable. 
14A. Power of court to engage experts.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions 
contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), in any suit under this Act, where the court 
considers it necessary to get expert opinion to assist it on any specific issue involved in the suit, it may 
engage one or more experts and direct to report to it on such issue and may secure attendance of the expert 
for providing evidence, including production of documents on the issue. 
(2) The court may require or direct any person to give relevant information to the expert or to produce, 
or to provide access to, any relevant documents, goods or other property for his inspection. 
(3) The opinion or report given by the expert shall form part of the record of the suit; and the court, or 
with the permission of the court any of the parties to the suit, may examine the expert personally in open 
court on any of the matters referred to him or mentioned in his opinion or report, or as to his opinion or 
report, or as to the manner in which he has made the inspection. 
(4) The expert shall be entitled to such fee, cost or expense as the court may fix, which shall be payable

amalgamated with another limited liability partnership, the new limited liability partnership which 
arises out of the amalgamation.] 
(d) when a company has entered into a contract and subsequently becomes amalgamated with 
another company, the new company which arises out of the amalgamation; 
(e) when the promoters of a company have, before its incorporation, entered into a contract for the

2[Substituted performance of contracts, etc.] 
3[20. Substituted performance of contract.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions 
contained in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), and, except as otherwise agreed upon by the parties,

such breach shall have the option of substituted performance through a third party or by his own agency, 
and, recover the expenses and other costs actually incurred, spent or suffered by him, from the party 
committing such breach.

failure to do so, he may get the same performed by a third party or by his own agency: 
Provided that the party who suffers such breach shall not be entitled to recover the expenses and costs 
under sub-section (1) unless he has got the contract performed through a third party or by his own agency. 
(3) Where the party suffering breach of contract has got the contract performed through a third party or 
by his own agency after giving notice under sub-section (1), he shall not be entitled to claim relief of specific 
performance against the party in breach. 
(4) Nothing in this section shall prevent the party who has suffered breach of contract from claiming 
compensation from the party in breach. 
20A. Special provisions for contract relating to infrastructure project.—(1) No injunction shall be 
granted by a court in a suit under this Act involving a contract relating to an infrastructure project specified 
in the Schedule, where granting injunction would cause impediment or delay in the progress or completion 
of such infrastructure project. 
                                                          
1. Ins. by Act 18 of 2018, s. 8 (w.e.f. 1-10-2018).

Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, section 20B and clause (ha) of section 41, the 
expression “infrastructure project” means the category of projects and infrastructure Sub-Sectors specified 
in the Schedule. 
(2) The Central Government may, depending upon the requirement for development of infrastructure 
projects, and if it considers necessary or expedient to do so, by notification in the Official Gazette, amend 
the Schedule relating to any Category of projects or Infrastructure Sub-Sectors. 
(3) Every notification issued under this Act by the Central Government shall be laid, as soon as may be 
after it is issued, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty days 
which may be comprised in one session or in two or more successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of 
the session immediately following the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in 
making any modification in the notification or both Houses agree that the notification should not be made, 
the notification shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may 
be; so, however, that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of 
anything previously done under that notification. 
20B. Special Courts.—The State Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, 
shall designate, by notification published in the Official Gazette, one or more Civil Courts as Special Courts, 
within the local limits of the area to exercise jurisdiction and to try a suit under this Act in respect of 
contracts relating to infrastructure projects. 
20C. Expeditious disposal of suits.—Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil 
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), a suit filed under the provisions of this Act shall be disposed of by the court 
within a period of twelve months from the date of service of summons to the defendant: 
Provided that the said period may be extended for a further period not exceeding six months in 
aggregate after recording reasons in writing for such extension by the court.] 
21. Power to award compensation in certain cases.—(1) In a suit for specific performance of a 
contract, the plaintiff may also claim compensation for its breach 1[in addition to] such performance. 
(2) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that 
there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is 
entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. 
(3) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not 
sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should 
also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. 
(4) In determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this section, the court shall be guided 
by the principles specified in section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872). 
(5) No compensation shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such 
compensation in his plaint: 
Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the court shall, 
at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just, for including a 
claim for such compensation. 
Explanation.—The circumstances that the contract has become incapable of specific performance does 
not preclude the court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section. 
22. Power to grant relief for possession, partition, refund of earnest money, etc.—(1) 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 (5 of 1908), any 
person suing for the specific performance of a contract for the transfer of immovable property may, in an 
appropriate case, ask for— 
(a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property, in addition to such 
performance; or 
                                                          
1. Subs. by Act 18 of 2018, s. 11, for “, either in addition to, or in substitution of,” (w.e.f. 1-10-2018). 


[Page 11]
11 
 
(b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the refund of any earnest money or 
deposit paid or 1[made by] him, in case his claim for specific performance is refused. 
(2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by the court unless it has 
been specifically claimed: 
Provident that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in the plaint, the court shall, at any 
stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including a claim 
for such relief. 
(3) The power of the court to grant relief under clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be without prejudice 
to its powers to award compensation under section 21. 
23. Liquidation of damages not a bar to specific performance.—(1) A contract, otherwise proper to 
be specifically enforced, may be so enforced, though a sum be named in it as the amount to be paid in case 
of its breach and the party in default is willing to pay the same, if the court, having regard to the terms of 
the contract and other attending circumstances, is satisfied that the sum was named only for the purpose of 
securing performance of the contract and not for the purpose of giving to the party in default an option of 
paying money in lieu of specific performance. 
(2) When enforcing specific performance under this section, the court shall not also decree payment of 
the sum so named in the contract. 
24. Bar of suit for compensation for breach after dismissal of suit for specific performance.—The 
dismissal of a suit for specific performance of a contract or part thereof shall bar the plaintiff’s right to sue 
for compensation for the breach of such contract or part, as the case may be, but shall not bar his right to 
sue for any other relief to which he may be entitled, by reason of such breach. 
ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS AND DIRECTIONS TO EXECUTE SETTLEMENTS 
25. Application of preceding sections to certain awards and testamentary directions to execute 
settlements.—The provisions of this Chapter as to contracts shall apply to awards to which 2[the Arbitration 
and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996)], does not apply and to directions in a will or codicil to execute a 
particular settlement. 
CHAPTER III 
RECTIFICATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
26. When instrument may be rectified.—(1) When, through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties, 
a contract or other instrument in writing [not being the articles of association of a company to which the 
Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), applies] does not express their real intention, then— 
(a) either party or his representative in interest may institute a suit to have the instrument rectified; 
or 
(b) the plaintiff may, in any suit in which any right arising under the instrument is in issue, claim 
in his pleading that the instrument be rectified; or 
(c) a defendant in any such suit as is referred to in clause (b), may, in addition to any other defence 
open to him, ask for rectification of the instrument. 
(2) If, in any suit in which a contract or other instrument is sought to be rectified under                   sub-
section (1), the court finds that the instrument, through fraud or mistake, does not express the real intention 
of the parties, the court may, in its discretion, direct rectification of the instrument so as to express that 
intention, so far as this can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in good faith and 
for value. 
(3) A contract in writing may first be rectified, and then if the party claiming rectification has so prayed 
in his pleading and the court thinks fit, may be specifically enforced. 
                                                          
1. Subs. by Act 52 of 1964, s. 3 and the Second Schedule, for “made to” (w.e.f. 29-12-1964). 
2. Subs. by Act 18 of 2018, s. 12, for “the Arbitration Act, 1940 (10 of 1940)” (w.e.f. 1-10-2018). 


[Page 12]
12 
 
(4) No relief for the rectification of an instrument shall be granted to any party under this section unless 
it has been specifically claimed: 
Provided that where a party has not claimed any such relief in his pleading, the court shall, at any stage 
of the proceeding, allow him to amend the pleading on such terms as may be just for including such claim. 
CHAPTER IV 
RESCISSION OF CONTRACTS 
27. When rescission may be adjudged or refused.—(1) Any person interested in a contract may sue 
to have it rescinded, and such rescission may be adjudged by the court in any of the following cases, 
namely:— 
(a) where the contract is voidable or terminable by the plaintiff; 
(b) where the contract is unlawful for causes not apparent on its face and the defendant is more to 
blame than the plaintiff. 
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the court may refuse to rescind the 
contract— 
(a) where the plaintiff has expressly or impliedly ratified the contract; or 
(b) where, owing to the change of circumstances which has taken place since the making of the 
contract (not being due to any act of the defendant himself), the parties cannot be substantially restored 
to the position in which they stood when the contract was made; or 
(c) where third parties have, during the subsistence of the contract, acquired rights in good faith 
without notice and for value; or 
(d) where only a part of the contract is sought to be rescinded and such part is not severable from 
the rest of the contract. 
Explanation.—In this section “contract” in relation to the territories to which the Transfer of Property 
Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), does not extend, means a contract in writing. 
28. Rescission in certain circumstances of contracts for the sale or lease of immovable property, 
the specific performance of which has been decreed.—(1) Where in any suit a decree for specific 
performance of a contract for the sale or lease of immovable property has been made and the purchaser or 
lessee does not, within the period allowed by the decree or such further period as the court may allow, pay 
the purchase money or other sum which the court has ordered him to pay, the vendor or lessor may apply 
in the same suit in which the decree is made, to have the contract rescinded and on such application the 
court may, by order, rescind the contract either so far as regards the party in default or altogether, as the 
justice of the case may require. 
(2) Where a contract is rescinded under sub-section (1), the court— 
(a) shall direct the purchaser or the lessee, if he has obtained possession of the property under the 
contract, to restore such possession to the vendor or lessor, and 
(b) may direct payment to the vendor or lessor of all the rents and profits which have accrued in 
respect of the property from the date on which possession was so obtained by the purchaser or lessee 
until restoration of possession to the vendor or lessor, and, if the justice of the case so requires, the 
refund of any sum paid by the vendee or the lessee as earnest money or deposit in connection with the 
contract. 
(3) If the purchase or lessee pays the purchase money or other sum which he is ordered to pay under 
the decree within the period referred to in sub-section (1), the court may, on application made in the same 
suit, award the purchaser or lessee such further relief as he may be entitled to, including in appropriate cases 
all or any of the following reliefs, namely:— 
(a) the execution of a proper conveyance or lease by the vendor or lessor; 


[Page 13]
13 
 
(b) the delivery of possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property on the execution 
of such conveyance or lease. 
(4) No separate suit in respect of any relief which may be claimed under this section shall lie at the 
instance of a vendor, purchaser, lessor or lessee, as the case may be. 
(5) The costs of any proceedings under this section shall be in the discretion of the court. 
29. Alternative prayer for rescission in suit for specific performance.—A plaintiff instituting a suit 
for the specific performance of a contract in writing may pray in the alternative that, if the contract cannot 
be specifically enforced, it may be rescinded and delivered up to be cancelled; and the court, if it refuses to 
enforce the contract specifically, may direct it to be rescinded and delivered up accordingly. 
30. Court may require parties rescinding to do equity.—On adjudging the rescission of a contract, 
the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted to restore, so far as may be, any benefit which 
he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which justice may require. 
CHAPTER V 
CANCELLATION OF INSTRUMENTS 
31. When cancellation may be ordered.—(1) Any person against whom a written instrument is void 
or voidable, and who has reasonable apprehension that such instrument, if left outstanding may cause him 
serious injury, may sue to have it adjudged void or voidable; and the court may, in its discretion, so adjudge 
it and order it to be delivered up and cancelled. 
(2) If the instrument has been registered under the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), the court 
shall also send a copy of its decree to the officer in whose office the instrument has been so registered; and 
such officer shall note on the copy of the instrument contained in his books the fact of its cancellation. 
32. What instruments may be partially cancelled.—Where an instrument is evidence of different 
rights or different obligations, the court may, in a proper case, cancel it in part and allow it to stand for the 
residue. 
33. Power to require benefit to be restored or compensation to be made when instrument is 
cancelled or is successfully resisted as being void or voidable.—(1) On adjudging the cancellation of an 
instrument, the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted, to restore, so far as may be any 
benefit which he may have received from the other party and to make any compensation to him which 
justice may require. 
(2) Where a defendant successfully resists any suit on the ground— 
(a) that the instrument sought to be enforced against him in the suit is voidable, the court may if 
the defendant has received any benefit under the instrument from the other party, require him to restore, 
so far as may be, such benefit to that party or to make compensation for it; 
(b) that the agreement sought to be enforced against him in the suit is void by reason of his not 
having been competent to contract under section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), the 
court may, if the defendant has received any benefit under the agreement from the other party, require 
him to restore, so far as may be, such benefit to that party, to the extent to which he or his estate has 
benefited thereby. 
CHAPTER VI 
DECLARATORY DECREES 
34. Discretion of court as to declaration of status or right.—Any person entitled to any legal 
character, or to any right as to any property, may institute a suit against any person denying, or interested 
to deny, his title to such character or right, and the court may in its discretion make therein a declaration 
that he is so entitled, and the plaintiff need not in such suit ask for any further relief: 
Provided that no court shall make any such declaration where the plaintiff, being able to seek further 
relief than a mere declaration of title, omits to do so. 


[Page 14]
14 
 
Explanation.—A trustee of property is a “person interested to deny” a title adverse to the title of some 
one who is not inexistence, and for whom, if in existence, he would be a trustee. 
35. Effect of declaration.—A declaration made under this Chapter is binding only on the parties to the 
suit, persons claiming through them respectively, and, where any of the parties are trustees, on the persons 
for whom, if in existence at the date of the declaration, such parties would be trustees. 
 
PART III 
PREVENTIVE RELIEF 
CHAPTER VII 
INJUNCTIONS GENERALLY 
36. Preventive relief how granted.—Preventive relief is granted at the discretion of the court by 
injunction, temporary or perpetual. 
37. Temporary and perpetual injunctions.—(1) Temporary injunctions are such as are to continue 
until a specific time, or until the further order of the court, and they may be granted at any stage of a suit, 
and are regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908). 
(2) A perpetual injunction can only be granted by the decree made at the hearing and upon the merits 
of the suit; the defendant is thereby perpetually enjoined from the assertion of a right, or from the 
commission of an act, which would be contrary to the rights of the plaintiff. 
CHAPTER VIII 
PERPETUAL INJUNCTIONS 
38. Perpetual injunction when granted.—(1) Subject to the other provisions contained in or referred 
to by this Chapter, a perpetual injunction may be granted to the plaintiff to prevent the breach of an 
obligation existing in his favour, whether expressly or by implication. 
(2) When any such obligation arises from contract, the court shall be guided by the rules and provisions 
contained in Chapter II. 
(3) When the defendant invades or threatens to invade the plaintiff’s right to, or enjoyment of, property, 
the court may grant a perpetual injunction in the following cases, namely:— 
(a) where the defendant is trustee of the property for the plaintiff; 
(b) where there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused, or likely to be caused, 
by the invasion; 
(c) where the invasion is such that compensation in money would not afford adequate relief; 
(d) where the injunction is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings. 
39. Mandatory injunctions.—When, to prevent the breach of an obligation, it is necessary to compel 
the performance of certain acts which the court is capable of enforcing, the court may in its discretion grant 
an injunction to prevent the breach complained of, and also to compel performance of the requisite acts. 
40. Damages in lieu of, or in addition to, injunction.—(1) The plaintiff in a suit for perpetual 
injunction under section 38, or mandatory injunction under section 39, may claim damages either in 
addition to, or in substitution for, such injunction and the court may, if it thinks fit, award such damages. 
(2) No relief for damages shall be granted under this section unless the plaintiff has claimed such relief 
in his plaint: 
Provided that where no such damages have been claimed in the plaint, the court shall, at any stage of 
the proceedings, allow the plaintiff to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just for including such 
claim. 
(3) The dismissal of a suit to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favour of the plaintiff shall 
bar his right to sue for damages for such breach. 


[Page 15]
15 
 
41. Injunction when refused.—An injunction cannot be granted— 
(a) to restrain any person from prosecuting a judicial proceeding pending at the institution of the 
suit in which the injunction is sought, unless such restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of 
proceedings; 
(b) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a court not             sub-
ordinate to that from which the injunction is sought; 
(c) to restrain any person from applying to any legislative body; 
(d) to restrain any person from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in a criminal matter; 
(e) to prevent the breach of a contract the performance of which would not be specifically enforced; 
(f) to prevent, on the ground of nuisance, an act of which it is not reasonably clear that it will be a 
nuisance; 
(g) to prevent a continuing breach in which the plaintiff has acquiesced; 
(h) when equally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by any other usual mode of proceeding 
except in case of breach of trust; 
1[(ha) if it would impede or delay the progress or completion of any infrastructure project or 
interfere with the continued provision of relevant facility related thereto or services being the subject 
matter of such project.] 
(i) when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to disentitle him to be the 
assistance of the court; 
(j) when the plaintiff has no personal interest in the matter. 
42. Injunction to perform negative agreement.—Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) 
of section 41, where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a certain act, coupled with a 
negative agreement, express or implied, not to do a certain act, the circumstance that the court is unable to 
compel specific performance of the affirmative agreement shall not preclude it from granting an injunction 
to perform the negative agreement: 
Provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract so far as it is binding on him.

fill up, sign and deliver in the manner provided in sub-section (2), an additional declaration and shall, 
along with such additional declaration (accompanied by the certificate of registration in respect of such

(2) The additional declaration shall be in the prescribed form containing the prescribed particulars and 
shall be delivered to the taxation authority after being duly filled up and signed within the prescribed

original token and shall cause an entry of such payment to be made in the certificate of registration. 
7. Liability for additional tax.—When any motor vehicle in respect of which a tax for any period is 
payable or has been paid, is altered during such period, or proposed to be used during such period in such 
manner as to cause the vehicle to become a vehicle in respect of which a higher rate of tax is payable, the 
registered owner or the person who has possession or control of the vehicle, shall, in addition to the tax, if 
any, due from him for that period, be liable to pay for the unexpired portion of such period since the 
vehicle is altered or proposed to be used, an additional tax of a sum equal to the difference between the 
amount of tax payable for such unexpired portion at the higher rate and the rate at which the tax was 
payable or paid before the alteration or use of the vehicle for that portion; and until such additional tax 
has been paid, the taxation authority shall not grant a fresh token in respect of the vehicle so altered or 
proposed to be so used. 
Explanation—In calculating the unexpired portion under this section any broken period in a month 
shall be considered as a full month. 
8. Production of certificate of insurance.—Every registered owner or person having possession or 
control of a motor vehicle shall, at the time of making payment of the tax, produce before the taxation

Chapter VIII of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (4 of 1939). 
9. Liability to pay arrears of tax of person succeeding to the ownership, possession or control of 
motor vehicles.—(1) If the tax leviable in respect of any motor vehicle remains unpaid by any person 
liable for payment thereof and such person before having paid the tax has transferred the ownership of 
such vehicle or has ceased to be in possession or control of such vehicle, the person to whom the 
ownership of the vehicle has been transferred or the person who has possession or control of such vehicle 
shall be liable to pay the said tax to the taxation authority. 
(2) Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to affect the liability to pay the said tax of the 
person who has transferred the ownership or has ceased to be in possession or control of such vehicle. 
1[10. Refund of tax.—(1) When any person who has paid the tax in respect of a motor vehicle 
produces before the taxation authority a certificate signed by the registering authority stating that the tax 
token and the certificate of registration issued in respect of such vehicle have been surrendered on the 
date specified by the registering authority in his certificate, such person shall, on an application made in 
that behalf to the taxation authority and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, be entitled to a 
refund,— 
(a) in a case where payment of tax has been made in accordance with clause (a) of sub-section (2) 
of section 4, for each complete month of the period for which such tax has been paid and which is 
unexpired on the date on which the tax token and the certificate of registration were surrendered, of 
an amount equal to one-twelfth of the annual tax payable in respect of such vehicle; and

of section 4, at the rates specified in Schedule IA. 
(2) When any person has paid the tax in respect of a motor vehicle and the vehicle is removed outside 
Delhi before the expiry of the period for which the tax has been paid and taxed in another State or the 
registration of such vehicle is cancelled before the expiry of the period for which the tax has been paid, 
such person shall, on an application made in that behalf to the taxation authority and subject to such 
conditions as may be prescribed, be entitled to a refund,— 
(a) in a case where payment of tax has been made in accordance with clause (a) of sub-section (2) 
of section 4, for each complete month of the period for which such tax has been paid, and during 
which the vehicle was removed from Delhi or such vehicle’s registration is cancelled, of an amount 
equal to one-twelfth of the annual tax payable in respect of such vehicle; and 
(b) in a case where payment of tax has been made in accordance with clause (b) of sub-section (2) 
of section 4, at the rates specified in Schedule IB. 
(3) Where the rates of tax leviable under Part B of Schedule I are increased by notification in the 
Official Gazette under sub-section (2) of section 3, the Administrator may, from time to time, by the same 
notification or by a separate notification in the Official Gazette, correspondingly increase the rates of 
refund payable under this section and the refund of tax payable in respect of the vehicles registered on or 
after the date of such notification shall be at such increased rates.] 
11. Penalty payable when tax not paid.—When any registered owner or any person who has 
possession or control of any motor vehicle used or kept for use in Delhi is in default in making a payment 
of the tax the taxation authority may direct that, in addition to the amount of arrears, a sum not exceeding 
the annual tax payable in respect of such vehicle shall be recovered from him by way of penalty: 
Provided that before giving any such direction the registered owner or such person shall be given a 
reasonable opportunity of being heard. 
12. Arrears of tax and penalty recoverable as arrears of land revenue.—(1) Any tax due and not 
paid as provided for by or under this Act and any sum directed to be recovered by way of penalty under 
section 11 shall be recoverable in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue. 
(2) The motor vehicle in respect of which the tax is due or in respect of which any sum has been 
directed to be recovered as penalty under section 11, or its accessories may be distrained and sold in 
pursuance of this section whether or not such vehicle or accessories is or are in the possession or control 
of the person liable to pay the tax or penalty. 
13. Exemptions.—(1) Where the registered owner or the person having possession or control of a 
motor vehicle is an agriculturist and that motor vehicle has been designed for agricultural operations and 
is used solely for such operations in relation to his own land then, that vehicle shall be exempt from the 
payment of the tax.

any public place for a particular period, being not less than one month, and deposits the certificate of 
registration of such motor vehicle with the taxation authority and obtains an acknowledgement therefor 
from that authority, he shall be exempt from the payment of the tax for that period.

under sub-section (1) or any motor vehicles belonging to any class of persons from the payment of the 
tax. 
14. Reduction of tax in cases of certain motor vehicles.—Where the registered owner of a motor 
vehicle used or kept for use in Delhi is a co-operative society registered under any law relating to                     
co-operative societies for the time being in force, the tax payable in respect of that motor vehicle shall be 
one half of the rates specified in Schedule I, if the taxation authority is satisfied, after such enquiry as it 
deems fit that,— 
(i) the co-operative society is solely enagaged in the business of transport of goods or passengers 
or both from one place to another in motor vehicles; 
(ii) at least seventy-five per cent. of the members of the co-operative society are its employees; 
(iii) at least fifty per cent. of the members of the co-operative society are not related to each other; 
and 
(iv) the motor vehicle is used or kept for use exclusively for the purpose of the co-operative 
society.

member if that member is the husband, wife, brother or sister or any lineal ascendant or descendant of 
that other member. 
15. Effect of payment of tax in other States with respect to motor vehicles brought into Delhi.—
Where in respect of a motor vehicle the tax payable under the law relating to taxation on motor vehicles 
in force in any State has been paid in that State for any period and that motor vehicle is brought into Delhi 
for use during that period, then,— 
(i) no tax under this Act shall be payable in respect of that motor vehicle; and 
(ii) the token issued in that State in respect of that motor vehicle shall be deemed to be a token 
issued under this Act, 
for such period or for a period of ninety days from the date on which the motor vehicle is brought into 
Delhi, whichever is shorter: 
Provided that the registered owner or the person having possession or control of the motor vehicle 
complies with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 4.

a motor vehicle is kept, or, 
(b) require the driver of any motor vehicle in any public place to stop such vehicle and cause it to 
remain stationary so long as may reasonably be necessary, 
for the purpose of satisfying himself that the amount of the tax in respect of such vehicle, has been paid.

99TABLE II 
Indicative criteria 
(A) Explosives :- 
 
An explosive means a solid or liquid or pyrotechnic substance (or a mixture of substances) or an 
article,— 
(i) which is in itself capable by chemical reaction of production of gas at such a temperature and as 
such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings; 
(ii) which is designed to produce an effect, by heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of 
these, of non-detonative self-sustaining exothermic chemical reaction. 
(B) Gas: 
(1)A gas is a substance which— 
(i) at 50° C has a vapour pressure greater than 300 k Pa; or 
(ii) is completely gaseous at 20° C at a standard pressure of 101.3 k Pa. 
(2)Substances of gas are assigned to one of three following divisions based on the primary hazard 
of the gas during transport; 
(a)Flammable gases: 
Gases which at 20°C and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa,— 
(i)are ignitable when a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air; or 
(ii)have a flammable range with air of at least 12 percentage points regardless of the lower 
flammable limit. Flammability shall be determined by tests or by calculation in accordance with 
methods adopted by International Standards Organization [ISO: 10156:1996] or by Bureau of 
Indian Standards [IS:1446-1985]; 
(b)Non-flammable, non-toxic gases: 
Gases which are transported a pressure not less than 280 kPa at 20°C, or as refrigerated liquids and 
which,— 
(i)are asphyxiant-gases which dilute or replace the oxygen normally in the atmosphere; 
(ii)are oxidizing-gases which may, generally by providing oxygen, cause or contribute to the 
combustion of other material more than air does; or{Hi) do not come under the other divisions; 
(c)Toxic gases: 
Gases which are known to be so toxic or corrosive to humans as to pose a hazard to health. 
 
Note.—Gases meeting the above criteria owing to their corrosivity are classified as toxic with a 
subsidiary corrosive risk. 
(C)Flammable chemicals: 
(i)Flammable gases.—Gases which at 20° C and at standard pressure of 101.3k Pa are:— 
(a)ignitable when a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air or  
(b) have a flammable range with air of at least 12 percentage points regardless of the lower 
flammable limits. 
Note.—The flammability shall be determined by tests or by calculation in accordance with 
methods adopted by International Standards Organization (ISO: 10156: 1996) or by Bureau of 
Indian Standards (IS:1446-1985). 
(ii)Extremely flammable liquids. —Chemicals which have flash point lower than or equal to 23°C 
and boiling point less than 35°C. 
(v)Very highly flammable liquids. — Chemicals which have a flash point lower than or equal to 
23°C and initial boiling point higher than 35°C.  
(iv)Highly flammable liquids.—Chemicals with a flash point lower than or equal to 60°C but 
higher than 23°C. 
 
 
 
 
 


[Page 120]
 
(v)Flammable liquids.—Chemicals which have a flash point higher than 60°C but lower than 90°C.  
(D)Reactive Substances: 
Reactive substances are those substances which start reacting chemically with any other material 
and reducing gases through their owned composition. Such substances are Inorganic Alkalies (for 
example NaoH, Iodine and the like) and Acids (for example H2S04, HN03, HCL and the like) 
(E)Oxidizing Substances: 
(a)Oxidizing substances: 
Substances which,while in themselves not necessarily combustible, may generally by yielding 
oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other material. Such substances may be contained 
in an article; 
(b)Organic peroxides: 
Organic substances which contain the bivalent-0-0- structure and may be considered derivative of 
hydrogen peroxide, where one or both of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic 
radials. Organic peroxides are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-
accelerating decomposition. In addition, they may have one or more of the following properties,— 
(i)be liable to explosive decomposition; 
(ii) burn rapidly; 
(iii)be sensitive to impact or friction; 
(iv)react dangerously with other substances; 
(v)cause damage to the eyes.

1THE INDIAN BILLS OF LADING ACT, 1856 
ACT NO. 9 OF 1856 
[11th April, 1856.] 
An Act to amend the Law relating to Bills of Lading. 
Preamble.—WHEREAS by the custom of merchants a bill of lading of goods being 
transferable by endorsement, the property in the goods may thereby pass to the endorsee, but 
nevertheless all rights in respect of the contract contained in the bill of lading continue in 
the original shipper or owner, and it is expedient that such rights should pass with the 
property; and whereas it frequently happens that the goods in respect of which bills of 
lading purport to be signed have not been laden on board, and it is proper that such bills of 
lading in the hands of a bona fide holder for value should not be questioned by the master or 
other person signing the same, on the ground of the goods not having been laden as 
aforesaid: It is enacted as follows:— 
1. Rights under bills of lading to vest in consignee or endorsee.—Every consignee 
of goods named in a bill of lading, and every endorsee of a bill of lading to whom the 
property in the goods therein mentioned shall pass, upon or by reason of such consignment 
or endorsement shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit, and be subject 
to the same liabilities in respect of such goods as if the contract contained in the bill of 
lading had been made with himself. 
2. Not to affect right of stoppage in transitu or claims for freight.—Nothing herein 
contained shall prejudice or affect any right of stoppage in transit,2 or any right to claim 
freight against the original shipper or owner, or any liability of the consignee or endorsee by 
reason or in consequence of his being such consignee or endorsee, or of his receipt of the 
goods by reason or in consequence of such consignment or endorsement. 
3. Bill of lading in hands of consignee, etc., conclusive evidence of the shipment as 
against master, etc.—Every bill of lading in the hands of a consignee or endorsee for 
valuable consideration, representing goods to have been shipped on board a vessel, shall be 
conclusive evidence of such shipment as, against the master or other person signing the same, 
notwithstanding that such good or some part thereof may not have been so shipped, unless 
such holder of the bill of lading shall have had actual notice at the time of receiving the same 
that the goods had not in fact been laden on board: 
Provided that the master or other person so signing may exonerate himself in respect of 
such misrepresentation, by showing that it was caused without any default on his part, and 
wholly by the fraud of the shipper, or of the holder, or some person under whom the 
holder claims. 
 
                                                     
1. Short title given by the Indian Short Titles Act, 1897 (14 of 1897), s. 2 and Sch.  
This Act is based on the Bills of Lading Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vict., c. 111). 
It has been declared to be in force in the whole of India except Part B States and the Scheduled Districts, by the Laws Local 
Extent Act, 1874 (15 of 1874), s. 3. 
Extended to former Part B States by Act 18 of 1949, s. 4. 
Extended to Union territory of Pondicherry by Act 26 of 1968, s. 3 and Sch. 
It has been declared, by notification under s. 3(a) of the Scheduled Districts Act, 1874 (14 of 1874), to be in force in the 
following Scheduled Districts, namely :—  
West Jalpaiguri, see Gazette of India, 1881, Pt. I, p. 74. 
The Districts of Hazaribagh, Lohardaga (now the Ranchi district, see Calcutta Gazette, 1899, Pt. I, p. 44), and Manbhum, and 
Pargana Dhalbhum and the Kolhan in the District of Singhbhurn, see Gazette of India, 1881, Pt. I, p. 504. 
Assam (except the North Lushai Hills), see Gazette of India, 1897, Pt. I, p. 299. 
2. As to stoppage in transit, see the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872), ss. 99-106.
